  - tweak: "Added some pretty colors. Red and blue to be exact."
  - balance: "The SM's bolts are more deadly now, they can do more damage, emp stuff, and blow shit up. Be very careful with high power setups. By high power I mean 2k eer above the zap threshold. This comes with a buff to tesla coils and the zaps, at least in the higher colors. Go to town."
